# BrNet
C networking library

this library is very easy to use even my grandma can use it

ds is the example to learn how to use it
```
#include "brnet.h"

int main()
{   // for domain ip

    getip("google.com");

    // for url source code
    src("https://www.google.com");
    return 0;
}
```

i will add 1-2 features everyday until i hit 1000 lines jus to master C🥀
